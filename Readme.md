# DermAI: Train Neural Network to Detect Skin Lesions

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the DermAI workshop series! This repository contains all the reference notebooks, code, and resources that you can refer to during and after the workshop.

## About This Workshop

Over the course of four sessions, we will go on a journey from Python basics to building, training, and deploying a deep learning model capable of classifying skin lesion images as either benign or malignant. This is a hands-on workshop designed for beginners, with a focus on building practical skills and intuition rather than getting lost in heavy mathematics.

We will be using a curated subset of the famous [HAM10000 dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) containing 1000 benign and 1000 malignant images.

## Workshop Structure & Notebooks

The workshop is divided into four parts. Each part has a corresponding reference notebook that is heavily commented to help you understand every step.

### **Lecture 1: Basic Concepts,b Python and PyTorch Fundamentals**
*   **Goal:** Get acquainted with basic AI concepts and terminologies, quick refresher on Python, and learn the fundamentals of PyTorch.
*   **Notebook:** [`Lec-1_reference.ipynb`](./Lec-1_reference.ipynb)

> Information for other lectures will be added as we progress through the workshop.
